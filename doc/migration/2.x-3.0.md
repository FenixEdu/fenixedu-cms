FenixEdu CMS 3.0 removes the concept of DefaultRoleTemplates, and solves many problems related with managing site permisisons.
It introduces SiteBuilders, to be used as a template to create new sites, using site settings stored in the SiteBuilder.
SiteBuilders have been build with expandability in mind, so any SystemSiteBuilder have a defaultRoleTemplate field, and extra on-site-create behaviour can be done in modules that use the CMS.
With SiteBuilders, Template is no longer necessary, and thus is also removed.
Sites will also have a defaultRoleTemplate, that will be assigned by default to new users.

## Migration

With your application down, run the following script:

run the
```
ALTER TABLE ROLE CHANGE `OID_GROUP`  `OID_PERSISTENT_GROUP` bigint(20) unsigned;
ALTER TABLE ROLE_TEMPLATE CHANGE `DESCRIPTION` `NAME` text;
```

## Post-Migration

It might be necessay to initialize your SiteBuilders and Site defaultRoles, this can be done either via the interface or via script.
